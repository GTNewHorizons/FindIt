# FindIt
##### For those times when you just can't remember where you placed your EV Mixer!

This is inspired by the "Search in nearby inventories" feature from 1.7.10 Extra Utilities, and from 1.12+ [FindMe](https://github.com/Buuz135/FindMe).  Instead of searching inventories, FindIt will search the world for placed tile entities!  

Did you forget where you placed your EV Mixer?  

Well no problem now!  Locate the item in NEI; however over it and hit 'Y' (the default keybind); if it's within range (+/-16 blocks) it will flash particle effects for you to locate it!
